Tic_Tac_Toe_Neural-Network
======

##Overview

This code uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of neural networks to play tic tac toe. It is written in pure javascript and uses Web Workers to have multiple neural networks train simulatenously by playing tic tac toe. The neural nets that win a game are given a reward and allowed to 'populate' the next generation via 'reproduction'.

##Dependencies

None. Pure JS.
